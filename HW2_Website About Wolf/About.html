      <p>
          Some species of wolves only live in the United States in forests and other areas where animals are plentiful for them to consume due to their dietary needs. You may be surprised to find that they can consume up to 20 pounds of meat in a single feeding. When it comes to the actual mating, only the lead male and female will actually do so. This is why it is often hard to get the number of wolves to increase. The body of a wolf allows it to be able to survive in a variety of different locations. The howl of the wolf can be heard from miles around. It is the trademark by which these very animals are known. The wolf is one of the best communicators out there when it comes to the use of body language. Sometimes fights over food sources can lead to the wolves having enemies that normally would not be there. The leader of the pack is the alpha male and his mate is the beta female. Many believe that the social order of a pack is determined by fear and dominance of the one in charge. It is estimated that at least 10% of the territory of a wolf pack is covered daily. They are not idle for very long, making it hard to track where they are actually at.
