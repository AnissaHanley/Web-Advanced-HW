			<h1> About Lost Identity </h1>


			<p>Lost Identity is a first person horror game. The main character has escaped from an asylum and ended up in the woods. He suffers from amnesia and multiple phobias. Due to his amnesia, he can not remember who he is and why he is in the woods. He must collect items in order to regain his memory. While in the woods, his Scopophobia, the fear of being stared at, manifests itself. While trying to regain his memory, he must avoid eye contact with the other escaped patients and animals that lurk in the woods. If his phobia is triggered, he blacks out. When he comes across a memory trigger, his vision begins to blur and his sanity decreases. He must blink in order to regain sanity, blinking away his past. This game will span across 4 episodes(games) where each phobia will be presented across different environments like a swamp, a church, and the circus.</p>
